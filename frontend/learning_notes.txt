export const publicRequest = axios.create({
    baseURL: BASE_URL,
    withCredentials:true
});
we are withCredentials:true, so we can set cookies send from the
server

also, while setting the withCredentials true we have to
app.use(cors({
    credentials:true,
    origin:process.env.ORIGIN_URL
}));
and we can't pass origin as wildcard '*' we have to mention the url
